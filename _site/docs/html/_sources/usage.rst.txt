Usage
=====

The individual modules in :any:`tippingpoints` may be used to carry out certain techniques or methods
developed during this project. For example, running :any:`scaling_methods.pse_sliding(t, z)`
will calculate the sliding-window power spectrum scaling exponent for time series ``z``.

In the modules :py:mod:`figures_c1`, :py:mod:`figures_c2` there is the code ready to reproduce particular figures
and tables from the thesis.
