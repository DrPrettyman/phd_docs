Documentation for PhD Thesis code
=================================

**PhD Thesis code** is a collection of modules containing experiments in the area of
*Early Warning Signals for Critical Transitions* pertaining to the PhD thesis of Dr Joshua Prettyman.

The project can be found on the GitHub repository `DrPrettyman <https://github.com/DrPrettyman/PhD_project?>`_
and the published thesis can be accessed at the
`University of Reading library <http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/98364/1/23022044_Prettyman_Thesis_Joshua%20Prettyman.pdf>`_.

.. note::   This documentation is currently under review as I translate many functions
            from the Matlab code and rewrite the comments as python docstrings, tidying up a few
            things as I go with the benefit of hindsight, experience and the versatility of python
            compared to Matlab.
