# Tipping points in dynamical systems

Tipping events in dynamical systems have been studied across many applications,
often by measuring changes in variance or autocorrelation in a one-dimensional 
time series. In this thesis, existing techniques in tipping point analysis are
reviewed and a novel method, the Power Spectrum indicator, is introduced. 

The use of this novel technique is justified by a study of the scaling 
behaviour of the AR(1) process which is used to model the critical slowing 
down phenomenon in dynamical systems exhibiting tipping behaviour. 
Methods for detecting early warning signals of tipping events in 
multi-dimensional systems are also reviewed and expanded and these 
techniques are applied to a variety of dynamical systems. An analytical 
justification of the use of dimension-reduction by 
empirical orthogonal functions, in the context of early warning signals, 
is provided. 

One-dimensional techniques, including the novel Power Spectrum 
indicator are also extended to spatially separated time series over a 2D field. 
The challenge of predicting an approaching tropical cyclone by a tipping-point 
analysis of the sea-level pressure time series is used as the primary example,
and an analytical model of a moving cyclone is also developed in order to test
predictions. We show that the one-dimensional power spectrum indicator may be 
used following dimension-reduction, or over a 2D field. We also show the 
validity of our moving cyclone model with respect to tipping-point indicators.
