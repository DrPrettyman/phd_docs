Reproducing experiments
=======================

The package ``thesis figures`` contains the following modules designed to easily
reproduce figures and tables from the PhD thesis. The module :py:mod:`plot_helper`
is used, rather than using ``matplotlib.pyplot`` directly, so that all figures
follow a standardised style.
